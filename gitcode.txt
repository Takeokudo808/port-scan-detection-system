Here is a code that will run straight in Git.

To run this code in Git(in the directory that contains the ssh.log.txt file for the port-scan-detecion challenge), just copy and paste straight into Git then press Enter.

file=ssh.log.txt
scan_count=$(cat $file | grep -i nmap | wc -l)
scanners=$(cat ssh.log.txt | grep -i nmap | awk -F ' ' '{print$3}' | sort -n | uniq)
targets=$(cat ssh.log.txt | grep -i nmap | awk -F ' ' '{print$5}' | sort -n | uniq)

main()
{
       echo "There are a total of ${scan_count} Nmap scan events."
       echo
       echo "Here are the list of scanners:"
       echo $scanners
       echo
       echo "Here are the list of targets:"
       echo $targets
}

main
